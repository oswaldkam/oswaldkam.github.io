The control panel is a specialized application designed for managing interactive elements for a live TV show [Chip In (籌旗)](https://www.facebook.com/ViuTV.chipin). It integrates seamlessly with Vizrt CG servers via APIs to control and display dynamic visual content, including real-time voting statistics and jackpot results. Statistical and jackpot data are processed by separate applications managed by other teams and fetched through APIs for precise on-screen visualization.

The program dynamically calculates and updates visual elements, such as bar chart heights, based on the fetched data, ensuring accurate and engaging displays. Production Assistants have intuitive control over the visibility of CG elements, allowing them to toggle displays with a single button click for maximum flexibility during live broadcasts.

Designed for mission-critical operations, the system utilizes dual-redundant satellite and fiber connections to guarantee uninterrupted performance, ensuring a seamless and reliable experience for viewers. This tailored solution provides robust tools for managing live, interactive broadcasts with precision and efficiency.
