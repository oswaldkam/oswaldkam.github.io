The game control panel is a specialized application designed for managing interactive elements of a single TV program. It integrates seamlessly with CG servers via APIs to control and display dynamic visual content, including real-time voting statistics, and jackpot results. The statistical and jackpot data are processed by separate applications managed by different teams and fetched via APIs for display.

This program dynamically calculates and updates visual elements, such as bar chart heights, based on the fetched data. Production Assistants can control the visibility of CG elements with a single button click, ensuring flexibility during live events. Built for critical operations, it leverages dual-redundant satellite and fiber connections to ensure seamless and reliable performance.
