A mission-critical application developed for live broadcast program - [Invest Smarter (智富通)](https://viu.tv/encore/invest-smarter), a financial TV program. It empowers Production Assistants (PAs) to control and customize on-screen content in real-time, delivering accurate and engaging information during live broadcasts.

Due to restrictions from the Hong Kong Exchange, the program does not connect directly to stock data providers. Instead, all stock price data and related financial and industry-specific information are delivered in XML format through the data provider's program. The Control Panel reads and parses this XML data to update CG elements dynamically, including rolling tickers, stock highlights, industry sectors, announcements, and news summaries.

With its intuitive design and robust functionality, the application allows for seamless editing and management of display content. Tailored for the demands of live broadcasting, it ensures reliability, compliance, and a polished viewing experience for audiences.
